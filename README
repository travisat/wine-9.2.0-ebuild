Why use this over vanilla wine from portage.  This one works great with source based games including cs:s.  It contains most of the patches from Codeweaver and is not updated every week.  I find it usually works with many games.

This is not completed the following issues that I know of are as follows:
1) Programs included with wine are not installed correctly.  These include winecfg, regedit, etc.
    These can be found in /usr/lib##/wine/fakedlls
    If anybody knows how to fix this please let me know
2) In order to get a usable /usr/bin/wine I cp /usr/bin/wineloader /usr/bin/wine in post install.
    I am sure this is not the best or correct way to do this, but for expediency I did this.
3) There are most likely errors in dependency handling as this is my first ebuild.
